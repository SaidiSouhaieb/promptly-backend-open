# Promptly API Usage Guide

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have the Promptly backend installed and running by following the [Installation](../README.md#installation) instructions in the main README.

- You should have the server running locally or deployed, with the backend accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).
- Set your `API_KEY` in your request headers for authentication.
- You need at least one chatbot created before uploading data or querying.

## Authentication

All API requests require an `x-api-key` header with your API key:

```
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY

| `BACKEND_PORT` | Backend port to run services in CI (e.g., 8230) |

### CI Pipeline Steps
1. Check out the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with injected secrets
3. Set up Docker Buildx
4. Build and start containers using `make start`
5. Wait for the database to be ready
6. Run Alembic migrations
7. Run tests using `make test`
8. Tear down services using `make down`

## Notes
- Models must exist locally in `llms/gguf/models/`
- Chatbots are isolated; each chatbotâ€™s vectorstore is independent
- Uploaded data can be files, QA pairs, or plain text

---

For support, contact your Promptly administrator or refer to internal documentation.


## Troubleshooting & Tips

- Make sure your `chatbot_id` is correct and belongs to you.
- Use the correct `model_name` from the supported list: currently `llama3` or `mistral7b`.
- Large files might take some time to process and index.
- Check logs using `make logs` if running locally with Docker.
- Keep your `API_KEY` secure and do not expose it publicly.

---

## Next Steps

- You can integrate these APIs in your app, website, or internal tools.
- Use the API key for authentication.
- Build multiple chatbots for different projects or clients.
- Monitor data sources and retrain your bots by uploading new data anytime.
